Four levels of Java classes are designed and offered by High School Student Daniel Li (USA Computing Olympiad finalist) to cover all of the material needed to take the AP Computer Science A exam.

Since 9th grade, Daniel Li has taught 16 courses of Java at the Horizons for Youth Program in Northampton Community College (each course covers a level) with over 300 teaching hours and over 100 students in middle and high school.

## Why Java?
* Java is the most popular programming language.
  * Java can run on nearly any system.
  * Java is the only language used in AP Computer Science A.
  * Java is used to make many games.
* Java is easy to learn.
* Java is easy to debug (find mistakes in code).
* Java runs reasonably fast.

##### Compared to other popular programming languages
* Although some languages such as C++ are faster, they are much harder to learn and debug.
* Although Python is easy to learn, it is much slower than Java, and it is harder to debug in Python than in Java.
